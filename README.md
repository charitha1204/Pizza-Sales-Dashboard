## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Insights  
The dashboard is split into two clean, interactive pages that provide both high-level KPIs and deep-dives into trends and sales performance:

### 🔹 Page 1: KPI & Sales Overview  
A high-level snapshot of performance metrics and product insights.

- 🧾 **KPI Cards**: Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Orders, Pizzas Sold  
- 📊 **Stacked Bar Chart**: Revenue comparison across Pizza Categories  
- 🍩 **Donut Charts**:  
  - % of Sales by Pizza Size  
  - % of Sales by Pizza Category  
- 📉 **Top & Bottom Performers**:  
  - Bar Charts for Top & Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue  
  - Top & Bottom by Quantity & Orders  
- 🎛️ **Dynamic Slicers**: Filter data by Month, Category, and Size  

### 🔹 Page 2: Trend Analysis  
This page dives into temporal and behavioral trends.

- 📈 **Line Chart**: Monthly Trend of Total Orders  
- 📅 **Bar Chart**: Orders by Day of the Week  
- 🍕 **Clustered Bar**: Category-wise Quantity Sold (Filtered for Specific Months)  
- 🔎 **Comparative Visuals**: Enables time-series and category-wise performance comparison  
- 🧠 **User Interactivity**: Designed with slicers and drill-down to promote exploration  

## 🧮 DAX Measures Created  
- `Total Revenue = SUM(total_price)`  
- `Average Order Value = Total Revenue / DISTINCTCOUNT(order_id)`  
- `Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(order_id)`  
- `Avg Pizzas per Order = SUM(quantity) / DISTINCTCOUNT(order_id)`  
- More detailed DAX used for visuals & dynamic interactivity
